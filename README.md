# go-rundeck

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/lusis/go-rundeck/master.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://circleci.com/gh/lusis/go-rundeck)

Go library and utilities for interacting with [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org).

## Legacy SHA

As promised, I've removed the older paths from the repo entirely. If you aren't using some sort of go dependency management, you should be.

The state of the repo that had the old `src` and `pkg/rundeck.v19` paths are available at the following SHA:

`08cdb7f7454e66fa3127e62cffc0ae7b05aa37c4`


## Design
The following is a small guide to the design of the project

### Isolation request and response from golang api

Requests/responses to/from the rundeck api are distinct from the higher level library.


### Version support

Min/Max version support exists around funcs that perform API operations.

I try *VERY* hard to specify the absolute minimum version a user can get away with but in some cases where there are breaking api changes.

I've also added environment variable support for specifying the version of the rundeck API you want to use. This can be used with the unified `rundeck` binary.

### unified rundeck binary

One of the pain points I faced as a maintainer was updating all the individual binaries when I migrated to a new API release.
Combined with the new version constraints in functions and the `RUNDECK_VERSION` environment variable, I can now offer a binary that should hopefully work across versions of the rundeck server.

As an example:

```text
$ rundeck logstorage get
+----------+-------------+-----------+--------+--------+-------+------------+---------+
| ENABLED? | PLUGIN NAME | SUCCEEDED | FAILED | QUEUED | TOTAL | INCOMPLETE | MISSING |
+----------+-------------+-----------+--------+--------+-------+------------+---------+
| false    |             | 0         | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0          | 1       |
+----------+-------------+-----------+--------+--------+-------+------------+---------+

$ RUNDECK_VERSION=14 rundeck logstorage get
Error: Requested API version (14) does not meet the requirements for this api call (min: 17, max: 21)
```

## Configuration

- set `RUNDECK_URL` to the base url of your rundeck installation (i.e. `http://localhost:4000` or `https://my.rundeck.domain.com`)
- set *EITHER* `RUNDECK_TOKEN` or `RUNDECK_USERNAME` and `RUNDECK_PASSWORD`
- if all three are set `RUNDECK_TOKEN` takes precendence
- `RUNDECK_VERSION` can be used if you're running a lower version of the rundeck server api but nothing has changed in newer versions.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this:

- as a library
- request/response types
- via the unified binary, `rundeck`

### As a library

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    rundeck "github.com/lusis/go-rundeck/pkg/rundeck"
)

func main() {
    // With environment variables
    // This is assumed that RUNDECK_* variables have been set prior
    client, clientErr := rundeck.NewClientFromEnv()
    
    // With configuration
    // rundeckConfig := &rundeck.ClientConfig{
    //     BaseURL: <URL>,
    //     Token: <API Token>,
    //     VerifySSL: <true|false>,
    //     APIVersion: <version>,
    // }
    // client, clientErr := rundeck.NewClient(rundeckConfig)
    
    if clientErr != nil {
        log.Fatal(clientErr)
    }
    data, err := client.ListProjects()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("%+v\n", data)
    }
}
```

### request/response types

As part of some design changes to the library, you can now just import the request/response types.
If you don't like my golang API and want to write your own, you can still benefit from the work I did ;)

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"

    "github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
    responses "github.com/lusis/go-rundeck/pkg/rundeck.v21/responses"
)

// SystemInfo represents the rundeck server system info output
type SystemInfo responses.SystemInfoResponse

// GetSystemInfo gets system information from the rundeck server
// http://rundeck.org/docs/api/index.html#system-info
func main() {
    ls := SystemInfo{}
    // data is populated via some mechanism where you get rundeck api json
    jsonErr := json.Unmarshal(data, &ls)
    if jsonErr != nil {
        log.Fatal(jsonErr)
    }
    spew.Dump(ls)
}
```

### `rundeck` unified binary

```text
$ go get github.com/lusis/go-rundeck/cmd/rundeck
$ RUNDECK_URL=http://rundeck.local:4440 RUNDECK_TOKEN=XXXXXXX rundeck help
Unified rundeck cli binary

Usage:
  rundeck [command]

Available Commands:
  execution   operate on individual rundeck executions
  executions  operate on rundeck multiple rundeck executions at once
  help        Help about any command
  http        perform authenticated http operations against a rundeck server. kinda like curl
  job         operate on individual rundeck jobs
  jobs        operate on rundeck multiple rundeck jobs at once
  list        list various things from the rundeck server
  logstorage  operate on rundeck logstorage
  policy      operate on rundeck acl policies
  project     operate on a rundeck project
  token       operate on an individual token in rundeck
  tokens      operate on rundeck api tokens
```
